## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

# Who are We?

* We are a bunch of Open Source enthusiasts, who love to share the culture of OSS. Through events and workshops, we try to share the different aspects of Software Engineering.
  
* We love to work on new ideas and projects, though we don't promote it from KOSS by default. You can find involvement of KOSS members in MetaKGP, developing on a project which is helpful for the KGP Community. You can also find members who are motivated enough to work on funky ideas and projects, which might range to solve a real-world issue, to create a project for banter, to help out folks learn a new language or framework.
  
* We inculcate an environment, where each of us work on anything that we might want to learn, and in return you would get fantastic mentors on the subject matter. Want to learn Frontend? Hop on to a call with [xypnox](https://github.com/xypnox); Want to learn more about Shell Scripting? [grapheo12](https://github.com/grapheo12) is informative to teach you. Infact, each one of us have carved their own specialization and have had their fair share of experience to guide you, so KOSS members are the goto folks.

  
## What do we do?  
 
* We are a college society to spread the culture of Open Source.

* We conduct workshops and events to share the culture of OSS with the KGP folks.

* We conduct [KWoC(Kharagpur Winter of Code)](https://kwoc.kossiitkgp.org/) which is a winter long contribution program for new contributors.

* We conduct Open Source Summmit, where we invite people from all around India about their experiences with Open Source Software.

## What do we NOT do?

* We don't coach people to crack GSoC. That is not our main objective as a society. If you want to join KOSS because of this sole reason, you are better suited to ask previous GSoCers about the same.
       
* We are not a research based society. We work on Software Development problems, and we use code to ease our approach to achieve our goals. We work on developing projects, which might be helpful for achieving our goals, but all in all, we dont develop projects for the sake of it. We use custom written projects to achieve our goals.
